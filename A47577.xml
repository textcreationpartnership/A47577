            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHriſtian Friends, of what degrée ſoever, I beg at all of you for Chriſts ſake, and the good of your own ſouls, to ſpend one half hour in reading over this ſmall Book, or tend to hear
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37688:4"/> the reading of it: let me entreat you not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great ſalvation, and lay by all your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied affairs to hear of the coming of Chriſt, of the great day of Iudgement, which is now even at the door; throw by all to prepare your lamps of Oyl againſt his coming; for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is a glory to them that fear him; but it will be a terrible day to the wicked, according to my Text of Scripture before laid down. Satan is now looſe in the world, he deceives four parts of the Earth: yea, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> he gathers together, whoſe number is as the ſands of the Sea; yea, he compaſſes the camps of the Saints, and the beloved City: ſo he, like a flying Locuſt, doth corrupt Gods people againſt the great Aſſizes to condemne them, when fire ſhall fall from Heaven and devoure the wicked, and the Divel that deceived the falſe Prophets of the world, ſhall be caſt into the lake of this fire and brimſton with them; then ſhall Chriſt ſit in judgement and power, and his Saints with him, judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the dead ſmall and great ſhall riſe and receive according to their works, and whoſoever be not found in the Book of Life ſhall be caſt in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for ever, where ſhall be wéeping and gnaſhing of téeth; but the righteous ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſée this, he ſhall rejoyce when he ſéeth the vengeance, he ſhall waſh his féet in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37688:5"/> blood of the wicked, ſo that a man ſhall ſay, <hi>There is a reward to the Righteous, verily he is God that judgeth the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 58.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Oh kearken I beſéech you and repent you of your former ſins, in what condition will that man be in whoſe works are not good, a fearful thing it is to loſe Heaven to obtain Hell, to loſe the favour of God, to be curſed with the Divel to lie in torments for ever. Rent your hearts and not your garments turn to the Lord all you that are heavy loaden of your ſins; are as red as ſcarlet he will make them as white as ſnow ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I do not deſire the death of a ſinner, but rather would have you repent and live. Dearly beloved Friends, the Lord doth not deſire you to go aſtray, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Call while its open unto you; for after death comes judgement; tis no referring your ſin of repentance: to day if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts; to morrow is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, and who knows what a day brings forth: Lie not wallowing in your corrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe like to beaſts; for the day of ſlaughter is nigh, a juſt reward is prepar'd for the wicked; the puniſhment of Hell might afright you but only you are a people of very hard mettle, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing of the Scriptures, like to the Scribes and Phariſées; but if like to them you do evil, you might partake of their puniſhments: alſo I ſay, how gloomy a ſight is the coming of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37688:5"/> Chriſt to the Righteous: for at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction God will wipe away all tears from your eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, whether ſorrow nor crying; neither ſhall there be any pain to thee, for the former things are paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but the fearful, and unbeliever, and the abominable, and unbelievers and whoremong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſorcerers, ans Idolaters, and all lyars ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death and terribleſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4, 8. it makes a reaſonable Chriſtian go out of his wits to think of the terrible puniſhment of Hell; ſtrive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſéech you to enter in at the ſtrait gate; <hi>For many I ſay unto you will ſtrive to enter in and cannot be able, Matth.</hi> 7.13. For when once the Maſter is riſen up and ſhut the door, and you begin to ſtand at the door knocking, without ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> but the Lord will anſwer, <hi>I know you not whence you are, depart from me all you workers of iniquity, Luke</hi> 13.25, 27. Oh what a diſmall Sentence is this to be deprived of the joyes of Heaven, and the preſence of Chriſt, wherein is all fulneſs of joy, lacking nothing, and reſt and peace for evermore. <hi>Conſider the Lillies how they grow; the toyl not, the ſpin not, and yet I ſay unto you Solomon in all his glory was not arayed like to one of theſe: if God ſo then cloath the graſſe which is to day in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37688:6"/> field, and to morrow is caſt into an Oven, and how much more will he cloath you, O you of little faith, Luke</hi> 12.17, 18. O conſider my dear Friends, and he better grounded towards God in true faith, through Ieſus Chriſt. You ſée and know that God is able to let you want for nothing ſo you will but ſerve him. Mark what God ſaith in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.4, 5. <hi>Whoſoever heareth the ſound of a Trumpet and takes not warning, if the ſword come and take him away, his blood ſhall be upon his own head: but he that taketh warning delivereth his own ſoul.</hi> I beſéech you Friends, now you hear this day the ſound of God in your ears, take warning hereby, prepare for the coming of Chriſt in the courts of Heaven to judgement; for aſſuredly that man that is found unprepared at that day will be in a moſt damnable condition, they ſhall burn as an oven; yea, and all the proud and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
